                <p>Sometimes people make me want to bang my head against a brick wall… why you may ask? Because
                        there is no common to their sense, there is no brain to their skull, most of all there is no
                        parenting to their parenting! You know, before I started my daycare I read up on everything I
                        could, state laws, criteria, any and every article I could find on children. Me and my husband
                        both took classes and we got our certifications. I wanted to be different than everyone else, I
                        wanted to be better; I was striving to be the very best and I still am. Unfortunately, everything
                        you read does not compare to the actuality of it. See nobody tells you that, they make it seem so
                        perfect; its not! Parents nowadays want to be their child’s best friend, that’s okay, but there’s
                        a time where a line has to be drawn. You can not give into every tantrum they throw, they feed 
                        off that. When they do it and you give them what they want, guess what? They are going to do that
                        every day! Parents seem to do anything just to get their tantrum throwing child to shut up. NO!
                        Stop that crap! Everyone is so quick to judge, stop that crap too! You CAN punish your kids. That
                        is okay! Spanking your kid(s), putting them in timeout, or taking their things away is perfectly 
                        fine! There’s a big difference between beating and spanking so figure your shit out! If your child
                        is bruised and/or bleeding you’re doing it wrong. You need to re-evaluate and check yourself
                        before you wreck yourself! When your child is being a little asshole you can’t just cuddle the
                        “ass” out of them. Doesn’t quite work that way. What you do with your children at home reflect on 
                        how they act when they are with other people, (cough, cough, the babysitter 🙋🏻🤦🏻‍♀️) so then it’s
                        my job to be the bad guy. You know how bad that sucks? The worst part is when you have to call a
                        parent because “billy joe” almost broke “Susie’s” neck by pulling the chair she was standing on
                        out from underneath her. When billy joe is 3 years older and “knows better”. In response the
                        parents think I’m an asshole and their kid is an angel and they will solve it by cuddles when
                        they get home… NO! You talk to your child about what they did wrong!!!! Your just teaching them 
                        that they can do whatever they want and their punishment is cuddles. I like cuddles, people
                        generally like cuddles. That is NOT a punishment! I love my kids. I love the fact I get to watch
                        each of them grow up. I hope to be apart of their lives for a very long time and see where they
                        end up. I’m not your typical baby sitter, I pour my heart out to these babies. I work very hard 
                        to be the best “co-parent” possible. We have fun learning everyday, sometimes they tell me to
                        “shush”, they aren’t always in the learning mood… learning isn’t always about counting, spelling,
                        learning the ABCs, etc… it’s having fun while not realizing how much you are truly learning. It’s
                        painting a “masterpiece”, looks like a million colors smudged together, but they are proud of 
                        that! It’s letting them use their imagination to its fullest, even if it means getting a text from
                        their parent that night wondering why “I didn’t let their child call them”, because they said
                        “they tried calling me from your Childs phone”… well first of all my child is 1 and the only 
                        phone he has is a plastic one that makes a rattle noise when you shake it, sooooooo.. 🤦🏻‍♀️ things
                        like this make me crazy. Anyways, kids will be kids we just have to help shape them and push them
                        in the right direction. You have to let them know right from wrong. YOU do, it’s your job too,
                        babysitters and teachers can only do so much. We have to work as a team. Kids need consistency, 
                        they are constantly changing every day. They need something steady in their lives. Routine, they
                        need it! I have pretty bad OCD, so I like having a schedule; I like everything to be clean. My kids
                        are like clock work, it’s great. They all get sleepy around the same time, want to eat at the same
                        time, go outside. Routine is important. A big thing that makes me different from others is the
                        fact that every hour or so I have to spray everything in the house with Lysol. Germs are a no go
                        for me. The kids do clean up time, when I start, they start. Every night I bleach the toys that 
                        can be and ones I can’t I hand wipe every. Single. Toy. With Lysol wipes. On the plus side they 
                        hardly get sick 🙂 which was my goal because before I opened and my son was in daycare, I missed 
                        so much work because I swear he was sick every single day, I always got a call! Don’t get me 
                        wrong though, that does not make my house sick proof unfortunately. Between cleans they still 
                        share snotty toys and yes they really do lick windows, they take turns licking them… why? I don’t 
                        think I’ll ever know, they are just weird. Parents just please help me be the best and others be 
                        better by doing your job at home. We care providers don’t like being the bad guys.</p>
