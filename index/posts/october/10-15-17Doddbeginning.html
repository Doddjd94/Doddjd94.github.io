                <p>Hey y'all, just want to say thank you if your reading this and taking interest in my day with
                   the minions. I started my daycare back in April of 2017. It's been a blast but by no means an 
                   easy journey! Running a daycare isn't just about the love you have for kids but, the patience 
                   you have. Let me tell you, you need it! My first day I opened, I was ready to close my door after
                   an hour. It was a tough day, the kids were in a new place, with a new person, everything was 
                   different for them and me. I never thought nap time was coming. When it did I was in tears, of 
                   happiness of course. The next day the kids were like completely different kids. It took one day 
                   for them to get comfortable. By the end of that week I was simply exhausted, mainly mentally.
                   It's been 6 months now, every day with them is different. My days are smoother, I knew I could 
                   do it. If you read this leave me some feed back, ask me questions. I'll continue to post everyday,
                   that's my goal.</p>
