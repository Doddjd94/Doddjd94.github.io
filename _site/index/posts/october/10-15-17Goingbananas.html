                <p>What is one of the hardest part about running a daycare?
                  I would have to say the mornings. Not only are you trying to drink your go go juice but your 
                  are also half dead while dealing with screaming kids because their parents just left. It's not 
                  so much that the screaming is annoying, but it kinda hurts your feelings. Like your secretly in
                  your head saying why don't you love me?!?. I love all my babies like they are my own, sometimes
                  they drive me nuts and I'm like glaring out the window waiting to see their parents car pulling up
                  the road so I can shove them out the door. Other times I wanna hold them hostage and not send
                  them home. My kids have me going through every emotion throughout the day. From sitting in the fetal
                  position hiding in the kitchen to laughing till I cry. One thing is for sure, they keep things 
                  interesting! Continue to stay tuned for the interesting things they do! Don't forget to give me some
                  feedback and share my posts!</p>
