                <p> Wanna know what it’s like using the bathroom when you run a daycare? I’d say it’s equivalent to
                    using the bathroom in jail. But a midget jail, and you’re the only normal sized one. You don’t
                    have privacy. You can’t lock the door, state wants the door cracked so you can see what’s going
                    on still. Anyways it’s pointless to close the door when they can open it anyways. The kids know 
                    right away when you step foot in the bathroom. It’s like an invisible alarm only they can hear 
                    when you go in there. The moment your butt touches the seat, they are already in the door way just
                    staring at you. You know how hard it is to use the bathroom with 5-6 toddlers just staring at 
                    you?!? I swear they don’t even blink!! Then they start getting closer and all you can say is 
                    “shoooo get away!, get out!” It doesn’t work… so you have one trying to flush the toilet the 
                    whole time, one who keeps bringing you toys and putting them in your lap, one who just keeps
                    throwing stuff at you, there’s always that one who keeps asking over and over “ what are you 
                    doing?” “Are you poopin’?!” “Cheyenne?.. cheyenne.., CHEYENNE!!!!!!” 🤦🏻‍♀️😫 then of course you 
                    still have that one who hasn’t moved or blinked still staring at you. Wiping your ass is nearly
                    impossible because one of them wants to see EXACTLY! what! you’re! doing!… 😳 Can you imagine how
                    it is when they are all mad? Let’s just say if you can’t pee with someone watching, look elsewhere
                    for your next career. <br/>
                    <u>Ps I’ve never been to jail, so I have no idea what it’s really like. Just have movie references for my analogy.</u>
