                <p>Wanna know what it’s like running a daycare? It’s called starving. Why? Because children are 
                        animals! They literally could eat a four course meal, say they are full, and that they can’t eat
                        anymore. Then as soon as you sit down to eat every single one of them surround you like Vultures 
                        and it sounds like the seagulls off “Finding Nemo” “Mine! Mine! Mine!” As you try to shoo them 
                        away ones already sticking their hand in what your eating and before you know it, your food is 
                        either on the floor or one of them has taken off with it. So those of you who wonder how I stay 
                        skinny, here you go. I suffer from malnutrition because of these minions. Just kidding, but really
                        as soon as the last one closes their eyes for nap, I’m no joke, high tailing it to the kitchen to
                        scarf something down before another wakes up.<br /> #MommaNeedsMealPrepSkills</p>
