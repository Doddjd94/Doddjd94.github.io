                <p>Daycare isn’t just about the babies, but the parents/guardians as well. Having a good relationship
                   with parents makes things much better and at ease. Especially when it comes to an in home daycare.
                   I mean you wouldn’t want people you don’t get along with or just pure awkwardness when they come into
                   your house every single day! They say business is business, don’t becomes friends with your “customers
                   “, in my case parents. You just can’t though. You need it; it keeps you sane. Because when your 
                   home all day by yourself, no other adults, with a bunch of toddlers. You thrive off the part when
                   the parents walk through the door so you can actually have a normal conversation, even if it’s only
                   a 2 minute one. The fact that you can talk to someone who understands what the crap your talking about
                   gives you a sense of relief! It does get hard though. Because pay day can somewhat be rough. We are
                   all adults and most have an understanding that this is a business. The hard fact is knowing that a 
                   parents is struggling but you can’t let them slide on their weeks payment cause you have bills too.
                   Not only that but then you’d have to do it with all your parents. Money is never an easy subject to
                   talk about let alone deal with. If your interested in this business be aware that this is one of
                   the toughest scenarios you will deal with. I emphasize “toughest” because trust me there are some
                   awful things we deal with along with choices we have to make.
