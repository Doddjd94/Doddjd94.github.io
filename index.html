                <p>Wanna know what it’s like running a daycare? It’s called starving. Why? Because children are 
                   animals! They literally could eat a four course meal, say they are full, and that they can’t eat
                   anymore. Then as soon as you sit down to eat every single one of them surround you like Vultures 
                   and it sounds like the seagulls off “Finding Nemo” “Mine! Mine! Mine!” As you try to shoo them 
                   away ones already sticking their hand in what your eating and before you know it, your food is 
                   either on the floor or one of them has taken off with it. So those of you who wonder how I stay 
                   skinny, here you go. I suffer from malnutrition because of these minions. Just kidding, but really
                   as soon as the last one closes their eyes for nap, I’m no joke, high tailing it to the kitchen to
                   scarf something down before another wakes up.<br /> #MommaNeedsMealPrepSkills</p>
