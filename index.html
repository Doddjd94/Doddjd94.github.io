                    <h4>What are Disadvantages of running an in home daycare?</h4> There’s not a ton but there are a few. One 
                    of them is the fact that you can’t leave the house Monday- Friday until you close. By then your 
                    just tired and you don’t want to leave. Another is your things get broken. They are kids, they 
                    will always do stuff you’ve asked them not to do. They are also very sneaky. Kids are clumsy and 
                    they spill things. Your floor might get ruined and so can your furniture. Being careful is not 
                    one of their strong suits. So beware of paint missing off your walls, dents, boogers, and 
                    something you have no idea what it is, but it’s there and you probably want to wear gloves to 
                    get it off... if you supply any food be prepare because it gets pricey. They have a tendency to 
                    be picky so food gets wasted. You may think it’s possible at first to afford all of it. But it’s 
                    not just like feeding 1 child, your feeding 6 or more children. Who are only taking 2 bites or 
                    just mashing up the food. Foods not cheap, so I suggest if you plan to feed them, make sure you 
                    add that extra cost into your daily/weekly fee. There are some pretty rough days, especially when 
                    the kiddos are sick. Whether it’s just one kid or all of them, you will want to hide because 
                    kids scream... A LOT when they are sick. They actually just scream over everything. They could 
                    want the floor to be blue one day, but that’s not happening, so they will scream for 3 hours 
                    straight... Money is a whole other topic, just use your best judgement and be realistic. Although 
                    most people think we are crazy and say they could never do this job. Honestly there are way more 
                    good days than bad. They may be gross and destructive but they will make you laugh like you 
                    never have before.
