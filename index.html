                  Job posting, employees needed!
                  Have you always wanted to be your own boss? What about being the judge on how much you make at the
                  end of the week? You could be making 6 figures a year! Sleeping in everyday in the comfort of your 
                  own bed. Having the freedom to go out and do whatever you want too. Enjoying all the time in the 
                  world with your little one(s), While literally doing nothing. Ha ha okay who am I kidding, that was 
                  all a lie. Besides getting to spend time with your babies. You know, there are always these articles 
                  on how teachers don’t make enough with everything they do; I 100% agree with that! What about us who 
                  run daycares? We handle the kids who can’t feed themselves, go to the bathroom alone, wipe their own 
                  butt, dress themselves, cant speak, can’t walk, etc... what about us? Some of us work 60+ hours a 
                  week and don’t even make enough money to put food on our table. You might say “well you don’t charge 
                  enough.” The sad truth is, to even make it in this business you have to compete with others and not 
                  by how amazing you care for kids, it’s the price. Today, most parents “price shop” for a daycare. 
                  Which is sad when you think about it. Parents don’t seem to care if their child is going to be in a 
                  clean, happy, safe, learning environment but, rather a cheap place and they are sold. Therefore, the 
                  ones who are actually out there, putting in the effort and extra money for learning supplies and 
                  activities but having to charge the amount that others who do nothing, are literally making nothing. 
                  Parents, do all of us who are trying hard to help your child grow, learn, and succeed; not only is 
                  but your child, a favor and look at what we can do, not how much we charge.
