                <p> As a daycare provider I’m always searching Pinterest and Facebook for all sorts of fun activities.
                    I absolutely love fall activities! Projects with leaves are so much fun! One of the projects we
                    did this week is we created a lions mane with leaves the kids collected from around the yard. I 
                    attached a link from where I got the idea so you can see other projects you might want to do. Now
                    I changed the way they did this; I made it more interactive for the kids. <br /><br />
                    I printed out the blank pages of the lion and got the paint ready for the kids. I use Cra-Z-Art 
                    washable kids paint, they aren’t very clean when it comes to painting. I picked out a few colors
                    for the kids, for a more realistic color instead of a purple or green lion. Just stick the paint 
                    on a plastic plate and then let them have at it. For the younger kids help guide them so they 
                    learn the paint goes on the paper not in their mouth😫! There’s a good chance the lion may not 
                    get fully colored and that’s perfectly fine. Every child has a different concept on what painting
                    the entire lion actually means. That’s what makes it theirs and unique. After they finished I wrote
                    their names on each page and we went outside to find leaves. Once again help the little ones collect
                    their leaves. The older kids will have a blast especially if you make it a race to see who can pick up
                    the most. There will be quite a few leaves, depending on the number of kids you have do this project,
                    I suggest a bucket or bag to carry the leaves in. Now it’s your turn! Instead of using regular Elmer’s
                    glue, the hot glue gun was way more useful! I cut out the lions head and traced it onto a colored piece
                    of construction paper. Then I took the leaves and glued them along the traced lines, place them however
                    you want. Take the painted lion head that you cut out and glue it onto the the construction paper where
                    you traced. There you go, you successfully created a one of a kind lion :). To persevere it as a 
                    keepsake, you will need a laminator. Otherwise the leaves will dry out and won’t last very long 😔.
